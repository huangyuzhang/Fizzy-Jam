Fizzy Jam is an out-of-the-box JAMStack web app practice.

It's much more than a starter. üòâ

## ü§î Philosophy

1. Everything lives in a git repo. This means you can host the site on GitHub, rather than paying monthly fees for web servers and databases.
2. A user-friendly yet pre-configured CMS. This allows you to focus on creating wonderful content, not the architecture or code.
3. Decoupled everywhere. Customize the site is fun by adding micro-services.

## üçπ Features & Usage

### LOGO & ICON

LOGO elements will be shown by the following priority:

1. **LOGO**: if the site LOGO is uploaded;
2. **ICON + Site Name**: if the site ICON is uploaded;
3. **Site Name**: if site name is defined.

> custom: `_includes/partial/header.njk`

### Routing

By default, Eleventy will generate HTML files based on the file structure in the `src` folder. That is, all entries inside `src/collections/post/` folder will be generated to `_site/post/`. So posts can be viewed at `www.yourdomain.com/post/post-slug/index.html`.

> custom: `collections/<collection_name>/files.md`

{% raw %}

However, you may define `permalink` in the front matter of each post or in `<collection_name>.json` for all files within the same folder. For example, in this project, posts are stored in `src/collections/post`. So we can define all posts permalink as `"permalink": "post/{{ slug }}/index.html"` by using `post.json` in the same folder.

{% endraw %}

> custom: `collections/<collection_name>/<collection_name>.json`

### Collection Entry Pages

* **Single Author**: Customize the author page by populate name, avatar, background image, social account links, location and bio.
* **Single Tag**: Contains the tag meta info and the posts with such tag.
* **Single Post**: The post page.

### Single Pages

Page is one type of collection. All pages are stored in the `src/page/` folder. You need to edit the `permalink`s for each page to customize their URL.

There are several layouts you can choose from:

* `single-page`: the post-like page, e.g. /about/
* `list-post`: post listing page, e.g. /post/
* `archive`: post archive page, e.g. /archives/
* `list-tag`: tag listing page, e.g. /tag/
* `list-author`: author listing page, e.g. /author/

> The `single-page` layout is sufficient for most of the time. However, you can always build your own layout for other purpose. 
> PRs are welcome!

### Primary Tag

The first tag will be treated as the "primary tag" in display.

### Primary Author

The first author will be treated as the "primary author" in display.

### LaTeX Support

KaTeX is used to support block LaTeX. Write the LaTeX equation directly into the post content, surrounded by two dollar signs:

```
Write equation like this: $$ e = mc^2 $$.
```

Then it will be rendered as:

$$ e = mc^2 $$

### Table of Content

By turning on the "Table of Content" option on post editing page, a TOC (generate based on the H2 & H3 titles) will be shown on the right of the post content. Table of Content is not available on mobile devices. 

### Code Highlight

Block code highlight is powered by Prism.js.

### Site Settings

Manually change site level settings.

#### Navigation

Add or remove items for the navbar or the footer area (coming soon!).

#### Settings

* **Site Meta**: Site Name, LOGO, ICON, description, footer info ...
* **Post Listing**: showFeatureImage, featureText
* **SEO Settings**: SEO title, Keywords
* **Appearance**: main color, link hover color ...
* **Components**: author box, code line numbers ...

### Comment System

TODO

### Other Features

1. Open external links in new pages.
2. Image Lazy Loading

## Netlify CMS Configuration

> file: `src/admin/config.yml`

### Collections

There are 5 collections by default: `post`, `tag`, `author`, `page` and `settings`.

`post`, `tag`, `author` and `page` are folder collections, so they need folders to store files with the same format. `settings` is a file collection, its embedded setting files are stored in `src/_data/`.

> more on [Collection Types - Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/collection-types/)

`tag` and `author` are relation collection used in post collection. So you need to first add new tags and authors before selecting them while editing a post.

#### Collection Slug

Slugs are used in routes, URLs and treated as the "id"s of entries. 
For example, the slug for a tag will be used in relation id stored in post files. It will be used also in generating the tag page: {% raw %}`/tag/{{slug}}`{%  endraw %}.

A slug only allows to contain "0\~9", "a\~z", "-", "\_" and "." (not start or end with "-", "\_" and ".").

## Eleventy Configuration

> file: `.eleventy.js`

Several JavaScript functions are introduced, so they can be used in templates.

| JavaScript Function         | Nunjucks Syntax                                             | Explain                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `string.split("seperator")` | {% raw %}`{{ myString | split(",") }}`{% endraw %}          | Seperate a string with defined seperator. |
| `array.includes(item)`      | {% raw %}`{{ myArray | includes(item) }}`{% endraw %}       | Check whether an item is in an array.     |
| `str.substring(start,end)`  | {% raw %}`{{ myString | includes(start,end) }}`{% endraw %} | Slice a range of characters of a string.  |

## Nunjucks Highlights

* Nunjucks passes parameters to included templates.

  > example
  > in `single-tag.njk`, we included `loop-post.njk`. So the {% raw %}`{{ slug }}`{% endraw %}(tag slug) in single-tag will pass to loop-post, which allows us to filter the posts has the tag: {% raw %}`{{ slug }}`{% endraw %}.

## Stacks

* Netlify CMS (git-based CMS)
* Eleventy (static-site generator, Nunjucks as the template engine)
* Bulma (CSS Framework)
* Components

  * Swiper Slider(TODO)
  * KaTex (LaTeX support)
  * Prism.js (Code Highlight)
  * Table of Content

## Limitations & Known Issues

**All data lives in the `src` folder, the Netlify CMS has its limitations on respond to certain relation modifications.**

* Duplicate entries may cause problems when generating static pages.
* Delete tags(collection item) or change tag slugs will not remove the corresponding tag items in post files(.md).

  > Removed tags are not displaying in front-end, so users won't see those tags.
  > However, still recommend not to change the tag slugs after creation.
